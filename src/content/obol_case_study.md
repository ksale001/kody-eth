# Obol: A Case Study

## TL;DR

I joined Obol in **July 2024** and helped expand GTM from a crypto native, ethos-led narrative (**Squad Staking**) into repeatable partner motions (**Lido SimpleDVT + EtherFi Operation Solo Staker**), while building the early institutional story and sales collateral, contributing to growth from \*\*\$100M all the way to \$2B\*\* in ETH staked on Obol DVs. 

**My north star:** decentralization and security. The market will always value APY and performance, but decentralization and credible neutrality shouldn't be taken for granted. 

---

## Context

**Company:** Obol builds software that enables Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). Charon is our middleware client that sits between Ethereum consensus layer and validator clients. 

**Timeframe:** July 2024 → Current

**Role:** Head of Product Marketing

**My scope:**

- **GTM strategy (ICP, positioning, narrative, messaging, competitive docs and proof points)**
- **Launch leadership** (cross-functional alignment, asset production, distribution plan, impact measurement)
- **Partner & ecosystem marketing** (protocol and institution partner motions, co-marketing)
- **Sales / BD enablement** (decks, objection handling, ROI framing, case studies, ABM collateral)
- **Growth programs** (Techne Credential,  incentive design)

## The story arc

### Act 1 — Squad Staking (operator-first narrative + pipeline)

When I joined, Obol had just shipped the **Squad Staking** narrative: friends (or strangers) team up to run a validator together and bring 32 ETH as a group. It landed with crypto-native operators because it was both **ethos-aligned** and **practical, reducing the** barrier to entry, and removing the anxieties associated with your machine going offline "your squad has your back!". 

#### Flagship campaign: “Squad Staking in Lido CSM”

**Strategy:** Make squad staking mainstream *and* prove Obol is a huge value add for Lido.

**Execution (what I shipped):**

- Owned the **CSM campaign motion** and positioned it as the easiest path to mainnet—split the 1.5 ETH bond across a squad.
- Hosted a livestream walkthrough and joined Lido’s community call as a guest.
- Managed onboarding, performance auditing, and distribution of the **Silver Techne Credential** onchain.

**Outcome:**

- **300+ individuals** deployed Obol Distributed Validators on mainnet via this motion.
- Techne became more than a badge, it was a **gateway** to future opportunities.

### Act 2 — Protocol PMF (real TVL unlock)

The operator-first motion helped our narrative and brand value, but it didn’t convert into meaningful TVL on its own, most independent operators didn’t hold enough  ETH. What unlocked TVL was a B2B motion with onchain staking protocols who were under pressure to decentralize their operator sets.

#### Case study: Lido SimpleDVT

**My role:** Owned the positioning and narrative (marketing side) and shipped co-marketing material and user facing collateral.

**Strategy:** A simple story, **Obol helped decentralize Lido.** More operators in more regions, less correlated failures, better for Ethereum. 

**Execution:**

- Built narrative and positioning that translated “DVT” into a win win scenario for both Obol and Lido. Expand the operator set while improving resilience and security. Anchor that to the ethos of the Squad Staking initiative that landed with the same users who were pushing against Lido's growth. 
- Objection handling:
  - **Complexity:** The added complexity is a feature, not a bug. The security tradeoff is worth it (threshold signing, reduced single points of failure).
  - **Fee:** Reframed as ROI: the DVT premium pays for itself quickly when you model it vs. downtime or incident prevention.

**Outcomes:**

- **200k+ ETH** staked on Obol DVs in the module. 
- **200+ operators** added to Lido’s operator set via this motion

---

#### Case study: EtherFi Operation Solo Staker

**Context:** EtherFi wanted to get ahead of the pressure that Lido was faced with. Decentralize their node operator set without sacrificing performance.\*\* Give experienced solo stakers a chance to run \*\***delegated stake** from ether.fi.

**My role:** Program and GTM owner on the Obol side.

**Strategy:** Turn Techne into a career ladder. **Learn about DVs → earn Techne → unlock delegated stake opportunities.**

**Execution:**

- Owned the relationship with the EtherFi coordinator (strategy, operator selection, rollout).
- Built a structured onboarding flow so CX had clear visibility into each operator’s machine health and key validator metrics.
- Set up support and escalation process with CX. 
- Ran a boots-on-the-ground awareness push that dramatically increased Techne demand.

**Primary objection:** Coordination and performance concerns. We addressed it by anchoring clusters with professional operators (DV Labs + Chainnodes) so each cluster had SLA-grade nodes while still bringing solo stakers into delegated stake opportunities.

**Outcomes:**

- **100+ operators** onboarded
- **40k+ ETH** allocated specifically to Operation Solo Staker
- Built confidence for the \$1B partnership to deploy stake on Obol DVs.

**Proof:**

### Act 3 — Institutions (the DAT era)

By 2025, decentralization was no longer sexy. Institutions were the biggest degens we'd seen yet. They "care" about risk management, but incentives were their main focus. The protocol-native pitch that worked for Lido/EtherFi/ Swell/ Stakewise, didn’t create urgency for DATs.

#### The pivot: Cluster as a Service (CaaS)

**ICP:** DATs first, then the long tail of institutional allocators.

**My role:** I authored the **CaaS deck end-to-end** and walked it through design. I owned BD enablement and positioning for this motion.

**Core hook:** “Rotate out compromised or underperforming operators, not your entire ETH stack. Avoid the exit and entry queue and keep earning rewards.”

**Urgency framing:** The 2025 Kiln compromise and the subsequent mass exits solidified the cost of single-operator failures. With multi-operator DVs, the incident could be handled by rotating operators and regenerating keyshares in hours, not months.

**Primary objections:** integration complexity, cost concerns, and “we like it, but it’s not a priority.”

**How we handled them:**

- **Complexity:  justified by security guarantees and operational continuity.**
- **Cost: Reframed as ROI: the DVT premium pays back quickly when you model downtime, exits, and redeployments.**
- \*\*Priority:  urgency was tied to real incidents (Kiln API compromise) and validator queue dynamics. \*\*

#### The signal: Institutional survey

We ran an **Ethereum Institutional Staking Survey** to generate leads and signal that DVs are part of the institutional meta. Lead-gen wasn’t the outcome, but the survey became a credibility artifact and helped maintain our brand strength.

## Outcomes

### 1) Techne became a compounding operator pipeline

- North star: Number of **Silver Techne holders** (high-performing operators).
- Once Techne was positioned as the gateway to opportunity, demand spiked and so did Sybil attempts. A lot of unglamorous work went into protecting program credibility.

### 2) Partner motions unlocked the TVL step function

- I championed the positioning and narrative that enabled broad protocol PMF. 
- Lido SimpleDVT + EtherFi partnerships were the two biggest TVL jumps during my last 2 years.

### 3) Institutional motion (still a WIP)

- Authored and shipped institutional collateral (CaaS) and enabled BD with positioning.
- Created >**1M ETH** of pipeline opportunities. 
- **Programmable staking (redacted):** launched a smart-contract product that unlocked distribution through a major institutional staking infrastructure provider (details redacted). Any stake routed through that provider flows directly onto Obol DV infrastructure.

---

## Hard parts

- **Sybils:** when Techne became the gateway to delegated stake, the incentives attracted sybil farms and maintaining the programs credibility required extra effort. 
- **Performance vs “pure decentralization”:** We live in a world of tradeoffs (unless you believe the blockchain trillema has been solved: Link: [https://x.com/vitalikbuterin/status/2007559523528233041](https://x.com/vitalikbuterin/status/2007559523528233041)) and leaned on professional operators to balance performance expectations.
- **Token incentive meta:** incentives bootstrap adoption; the next growth leg must come from durable value. I've long believed that ILG (incentive led growth) muddies the water as to what has PMF and what doesn't. 
- **Institutional:** “not a priority” is the hardest objection in a crowded market.

---

## What I’d do again / do differently

**Do again:**

- **Techne as a gateway.** The opportunity carrot attracted many rabbits. 
- **Programmable staking GTM (redacted).** Favorite GTM to date (hope to share publicly soon). 
- **Institutional positioning + messaging.** The operator-rotation and key-compromise story is foundational for security-driven institutions.

**Change:**

- **Move B2B sooner.** Squad staking was a huge win, but I would have gotten in front of DATs and institutions earlier, before the space got crowded.
- **Build a flagship  account package.** Our best flagship partner is **Lido**. I would have packaged Lido’s DV performance into more institution readable collateral earlier.
- **Design earlier for life after incentives.** Invest sooner in proof points that sell security as durable value.
