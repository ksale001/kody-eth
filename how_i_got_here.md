Since this is a decentralized site, I feel the need to share how I ended up here. Long before Ethereum, I was interested in using things that felt different from the normal internet.  Usenet was definitely the foundation, then came the MP3-sharing era: Napster, BearShare, and every other app that popped up trying to fill the gap. It was a little sketchy, but honestly kind of magical. Looking back, it laid the groundwork for the decentralization principles I feel attached to within crypto. 

The moment that pulled me down the rabbit hole a little further, though, wasn’t file sharing. It was an application I downloaded on PS3 called Folding@home. Folding@home is a distributed computing application where you donate spare compute power to run protein-folding simulations that help researchers study diseases that would otherwise be too expensive or too slow to model. Back then, the idea that a bunch of regular people, kids, really, could contribute to something powerful enough to push science forward felt very profound.

Digging into decentralized compute led me to Bitcoin, which happened to be during the Silk Road era. Seeing people transact in something other than dollars gave me the same feeling I had with Folding@home, it felt new, it felt weird, it felt like "i like money" (link out to i like money meme from idiocracy). Bitcoin was (and is) an incredible invention, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for it. But today, it’s largely a store of value, plain and simple.

I found Ethereum in 2017 during the ICO boom, and that was my latest *aha* moment. Ethereum was more than just money, it was home to a programming language, smart contracts, art, ICOs and tokens. It was a net new ecosystem, one that anyone could connect to from their computer. I’m convinced we’ll look back on this era and realize how much the world changed because of it.

On the builder front, I stayed mostly sidelined until the beacon chain launch. Proof of Stake was a paradigm shift. The design space was suddenly wide open. LSDs (which eventually became “LSTs” for whatever reason 😉) started to take off. Decentralized staking pools like Rocket Pool gained traction. Staking just grabbed my mindshare. That obsession led me to a simple question: how can solo stakers remain competitive when staking matures? My answer at the time (although slightly naive) was to pool together MEV rewards and create new incentives through public goods funding. 

The EF was supportive of this effort and helped fund R&D. Decentralization was sexy back then and the solo staking community was strong (likely because we accounted for a large share of the actual independent node operators). I put the product on paper, found a rockstar full stack developer, and partnered with Anthony Sassano, EthStaker, Aestus Relay, and Yorrick (king of eth-docker) to help run the decentralized infrastructure. We launched smoothly.money as an open-source public good which grew to ~$20M in TVL and outperformed on APY thanks to the donations that poured in from the ecosystem!  

Somewhere along the way, “incentivize solo staking” became a meme.

Around that time, I saw Obol publish an initiative called “1% for decentralization,” where a portion of rewards from stake run on Obol Distributed Validators gets redistributed back to the community to fund projects that strengthen Ethereum’s decentralization. That hit me hard. While building Smoothly, that kind of funding would have been massively valuable. I joined Obol shortly after.

Now, almost two years later, I lead product marketing at Obol,  and I’m more excited than ever to be working in the Ethereum ecosystem. Today, it feels like we’re standing at another inflection point. Just like the shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake opened a new frontier, the move toward ZK feels like another era where the design space is wide open again.

And that’s the thing I love most about Ethereum: we never stop pushing forward. The ecosystem rewards curiosity. Anyone can show up with a real idea, post it on ethresearch or ethmagicians, and get thoughtful feedback. Ethereum is open to anyone who wants to contribute and that gives me a sense of purpose I never felt in my tradjob days.
