# kody.eth

Personal site + experiments. Built to feel like a terminal, but still usable.

## what’s inside

- main landing page (ASCII/terminal vibe)
- pong hero module (vanilla JS)
- Smoothly case study page

## run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## structure

- `src/App.jsx` — UI + content
- `public/` — static assets + `pong-hero.js`
- `smoothly_case_study.md` — source copy for the case study

## notes

If something feels off, it probably is. Open an issue or ping me.
